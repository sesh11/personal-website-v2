I am a son, husband, and father. I am very fortunate to have a wonderful family that puts up with me. Mid-2022 is when my wife and I knew we were going to have a baby and this changed a lot of things for me. For the first time in my life, I stopped making excuses about a lack of time. The experience allowed me to focus on what is important. I have since prioritized self-learning, reading, and working out. I have found that there is always a way to create more time for the things that are truly important. I call them "mental unlocks". This is a journey that I am on and I am excited to see where it takes me.
