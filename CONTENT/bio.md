Hi, I'm Nithin. Thank you for taking the time to visit my website. There has never been a better time to build. I built this website from scratch for three reasons: 
1. To build a personal website that is a reflection of my work and interests. 
2. My first use case with Cursor and understanding the potential and limits of AI-assisted development.
3. Simply because I can.

My objective is to to get better everyday in every facet of life. I believe we are the cusp of a new era of human evolution and I want to be a part of it.
