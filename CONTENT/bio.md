Hi, I'm Nithin. Thank you for taking the time to visit my website. There has never been a better time to build. I built this website from scratch for three reasons: 
1. To build a personal website that is a reflection of my work and interests. 
2. My first use case with Cursor and understanding the potential and limits of AI-assisted development.
3. Simply because I can.

My objective is to to get better everyday in every facet of life. I believe we are the cusp of a new era of human evolution and I want to be a part of it. 

Professional
I'm a technology executive at a healthcare company. I lead a team of engineers and consultants to deliver innovative solutions and drive transformative experiences with Cloud and AI. Prior to this, I was a consultant focused on modernizing legacy systems and building new platforms and products for healthcare and government clients. 

Personal
I am a son, husband, and father. I am very fortunate to have a wonderful family that puts up with me. Mid-2022 is when my wife and I knew we were going to have a baby and this changed a lot of things for me. For the first time in my life, I stopped making excuses about a lack of time. The experience allowed me to focus on what is important. I have since prioritized self-learning, reading, and working out. I have found that there is always a way to create more time for the things that are truly important. I call them "mental unlocks". This is a journey that I am on and I am excited to see where it takes me.
