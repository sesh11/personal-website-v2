This is the code to my personal website. This is built using REACT for the front-end with AWS S3 static website hosting. I have a dynamic component that reads and renders content from a private S3 bucket. My main website is at https://nsesh.com . This was my first project using Cursor. I used Claude to help me with the AWS setup (CDN, Lambda, API Gateway, etc.) Thoroughly enjoyed every moment of it. The finishing touches to the MVP for this website was done using Agent mode on Cursor. Truly, there has never been a better time to just do things.
